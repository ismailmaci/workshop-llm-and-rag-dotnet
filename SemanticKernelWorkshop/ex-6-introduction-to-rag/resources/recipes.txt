Butterflied Chicken with Leek, Fetta & Rosemary Potatoes
A few simple touches in this meal make it something really
special. Finishing the butterflied chicken breast with sweet,
sautéed leek and sharp, creamy fetta allows it to absorb all of
those lovely flavours and stay nice and moist to boot. Meanwhile,
rosemary (our fave!), gives the potatoes a rich, aromatic quality.

2 Place the potato in a large saucepan of cold, salted water. Bring
the potato to the boil and cook for 15 minutes, or until soft when
pricked with a knife. Add the green beans in the last 2 minutes of the
potato cooking time. Drain and return the potato and beans back to
the saucepan. Toss with the butter and rosemary, and season with

a medium frying pan. Add the leek and cook for 8-10 minutes, or until
soft and sweet. Remove from the heat. Add the crumbled fetta cheese
to the leek and season to taste with pepper. Spoon the fetta and leek
mixture on top of the chicken breast and return to the grill for

5 To serve, divide the leek and fetta chicken, rosemary potato and
beans, and lemon wedges between plates. Enjoy!

You will need: chef’s knife, chopping board, sieve, three shallow bowls,
two plates, large frying pan, tongs, paper towel, large bowl and small
jug.
1 Set up the crumbing station. Prepare three shallow bowls. In the
first, place the plain flour and a good grind of salt and pepper. In the
second, the whisked egg with a dash of water. In the third, the panko
breadcrumbs. Take each pork schnitzel fillet and dip it in the flour,
then into the egg wash, and then into the breadcrumb mixture. Lay
them out on a plate, ready to fry.
Tip: If you don’t have an egg, replace it with 2 tbs milk.
2 Heat the vegetable oil in a large frying pan over a high heat. Fry
half the crumbed pork for 3-4 minutes on each side, or until golden
on the outside and cooked through. Set the pork aside on a plate
with paper towel, to soak up any excess oil. Wipe the frying pan clean
if needed and repeat the process with the remaining pork and some
extra oil if needed.
3 Combine the rocket leaves, apple slices and shaved Parmesan
cheese in a large bowl. In a small jug, combine the olive oil, honey
and apple cider vinegar. Season with salt and pepper. Drizzle the
dressing over the salad.
4 To serve, divide the pork and salad between plates. Enjoy!
Did you know? The term “schnitzel” comes from the German word “sniz”
meaning slice.

toothpicks, two oven trays lined with baking paper, large ovenproof frying
pan, tongs and aluminium foil.
1 Preheat the oven to 200°C/180°C fan-forced.

a deep, horizontal slit into the side of each chicken breast (don’t slice all
the way through). Stuff the chicken with a small spoonful of the roughly
chopped sundried tomatoes and crumbled fetta cheese. Secure it shut
using two toothpicks (if you don’t have toothpicks just be careful when
you flip the chicken in the pan). Set aside.

the olive oil and season with salt and pepper. Place in the oven and cook
for 20-25 minutes, or until cooked through. Place the asparagus on the
second lined tray, drizzle with the remaining olive oil and season with salt
and pepper. Add to the oven in the last 10 minutes of cooking time.
